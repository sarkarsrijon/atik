# Arnoldi Tikhonov Method

One of the most recognized schemes for regularization in ill-posed inverse problems. As presented <a href="https://sarkarsrijon.github.io/blog/2025/atik-method/" target="_blank">here</a>, I derive it along with two function definitions. The user could write their own Newton's method implementation (`nm`) for both files. The notations in the codes are the same as those used in the derivation.
